# Scoreboard Sample
Create a sample scoreboard application to demonstrate proficiency in web development. Example scores and stats can be of any sport/game or other example scenario and can have any UI elements you desire. Data can be hard-coded, random, or externally sourced. Code is more important than appearance, but app should include examples both styling and scripting. App should be a single-page web app with the following requirements:

## View - Scores
Load and display a list of scores of recent games. Example should illustrate scores updating and new games added periodically. Clicking on a game should bring you to Details view.
![scoreboard](./scores.png)

## View - Details
Load and show activity/details for one specific game.
![details](./details.png)

## IFrame Data Source
App should communicate with a page in a hidden iframe as the source of all data. Data source page should deliver results both in response to request from app, such as an initial load of scores/details, as well as providing unsolicited updates of new games and scores asynchronously.

## Delivery
Please submit code by pull-request in this repo.
